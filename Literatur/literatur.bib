 abstract = {In recent years, atomic force microscopy (AFM) based single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) extended our understanding of molecular properties and functions. It gave us the opportunity to explore a multiplicity of biophysical mechanisms, e.g., how bacterial adhesins bind to host surface receptors in more detail. Among other factors, the success of SMFS experiments depends on the functional and native immobilization of the biomolecules of interest on solid surfaces and AFM tips. Here, we describe a straightforward protocol for the covalent coupling of proteins to silicon surfaces using silane-PEG-carboxyls and the well-established N-hydroxysuccinimid/1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)carbodiimid (EDC/NHS) chemistry in order to explore the interaction of pilus-1 adhesin RrgA from the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) with the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (Fn). Our results show that the surface functionalization leads to a homogenous distribution of Fn on the glass surface and to an appropriate concentration of RrgA on the AFM cantilever tip, apparent by the target value of up to 20{\%} of interaction events during SMFS measurements and revealed that RrgA binds to Fn with a mean force of 52 pN. The protocol can be adjusted to couple via site specific free thiol groups. This results in a predefined protein or molecule orientation and is suitable for other biophysical applications besides the SMFS.},

@article{Bell.1978,
 abstract = {A theoretical framework is proposed for the analysis of adhesion between cells or of cells to surfaces when the adhesion is mediated by reversible bonds between specific molecules such as antigen and antibody, lectin and carbohydrate, or enzyme and substrate. From a knowledge of the reaction rates for reactants in solution and of their diffusion constants both in solution and on membranes, it is possible to estimate reaction rates for membrane-bound reactants. Two models are developed for predicting the rate of bond formation between cells and are compared with experiments. The force required to separate two cells is shown to be greater than the expected electrical forces between cells, and of the same order of magnitude as the forces required to pull gangliosides and perhaps some integral membrane proteins

The challenge in its use is the controlled positioning of one of the components of an interaction on a carefully designed surface. Many attempts in interaction analysis fail due to the non-functional or unsuccessful immobilization of a reactant onto the complex matrix of that surface. The most common technique for linking ligands covalently to a hydrophilic solid surface is amine coupling via reactive esters. In this chapter detailed methods and problem discussions will be given to assist in fast decision analysis to optimize immobilization and regeneration. Topics in focus are different coupling techniques for small and large molecules, streptavidin-biotin sandwich immobilization, and optimizing regeneration conditions.},

 abstract = {The effect of mechanical force on the free-energy surface that governs a chemical reaction is largely unknown. The combination of protein engineering with single-molecule force-clamp spectroscopy allows us to study the influence of mechanical force on the rate at which a protein disulfide bond is reduced by nucleophiles in a bimolecular substitution reaction (S(N)2). We found that cleavage of a protein disulfide bond by hydroxide anions exhibits an abrupt reactivity 'switch' at $\sim$500 pN, after which the accelerating effect of force on the rate of an S(N)2 chemical reaction greatly diminishes. We propose that an abrupt force-induced conformational change of the protein disulfide bond shifts its ground state, drastically changing its reactivity in S(N)2 chemical reactions. Our experiments directly demonstrate the action of a force-activated switch in the chemical reactivity of a single molecule.},

@article{Marszalek.2002,
 abstract = {Under a stretching force, the sugar ring of polysaccharide molecules switches from the chair to the boat-like or inverted chair conformation. This conformational change can be observed by stretching single polysaccharide molecules with an atomic force microscope. In those early experiments, the molecules were stretched at a constant rate while the resulting force changed over wide ranges. However, because the rings undergo force-dependent transitions, an experimental arrangement where the force is the free variable introduces an undesirable level of complexity in the results. Here we demonstrate the use of force-ramp atomic force microscopy to capture the conformational changes in single polysaccharide molecules. Force-ramp atomic force microscopy readily captures the ring transitions under conditions where the entropic elasticity of the molecule is separated from its conformational transitions, enabling a quantitative analysis of the data with a simple two-state model. This analysis directly provides the physico-chemical characteristics of the ring transitions such as the width of the energy barrier, the relative energy of the conformers, and their enthalpic elasticity. Our experiments enhance the ability of single-molecule force spectroscopy to make high-resolution measurements of the conformations of single polysaccharide molecules under a stretching force, making an important addition to polysaccharide spectroscopy.},

@article{Merkel.1999,
 abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been used to measure the strength of bonds between biological receptor molecules and their ligands. But for weak noncovalent bonds, a dynamic spectrum of bond strengths is predicted as the loading rate is altered, with the measured strength being governed by the prominent barriers traversed in the energy landscape along the force-driven bond-dissociation pathway. In other words, the pioneering early AFM measurements represent only a single point in a continuous spectrum of bond strengths, because theory predicts that these will depend on the rate at which the load is applied. Here we report the strength spectra for the bonds between streptavidin (or avidin) and biotins-the prototype of receptor-ligand interactions used in earlier AFM studies, and which have been modelled by molecular dynamics. We have probed bond formation over six orders of magnitude in loading rate, and find that the bond survival time diminished from about 1 min to 0.001 s with increasing loading rate over this range. The bond strength, meanwhile, increased from about 5 pN to 170 pN. Thus, although they are among the strongest noncovalent linkages in biology (affinity of 10(13) to 10(15) M(-1)), these bonds in fact appear strong or weak depending on how fast they are loaded. We are also able to relate the activation barriers derived from our strength spectra to the shape of the energy landscape derived from simulations of the biotin-avidin complex.},

An external force has been previously shown both experimentally and theoretically to act as a catalyst for the scission of a disulfide bond in thiol/disulfide exchange reactions. How the dynamics of peptide hydrolysis, one of the most prevalent biochemical reactions, is influenced by a stretching force was investigated here using combined quantum and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations together with transition path sampling. Our simulations predict mechanical force to only marginally enhance the reactivity of the rate-limiting step, the nucleophilic attack of hydroxide to the peptide moiety, and not to alter the reaction mechanism, even though the peptide bond and its \textgreek{p}-electron conjugation is weakened by force. We describe a previously unidentified hydrogen bonded intermediate state, which is likely to play a role in general in base-catalyzed and analogous enzymatic reactions. Our predictions can be directly tested by single molecule stretching experiments.},
